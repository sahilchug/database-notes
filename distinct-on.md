The requirement for the `ORDER BY` and `DISTINCT ON` expressions to match in PostgreSQL queries stems from the way `DISTINCT ON` is designed to function. Here’s an in-depth explanation:

### Purpose of `DISTINCT ON`
`DISTINCT ON` is a PostgreSQL-specific feature that provides a powerful and flexible way to control which rows are returned based on the uniqueness of specific columns. Unlike a plain `DISTINCT`, which eliminates duplicate rows based on all columns in the result set, `DISTINCT ON` allows you to specify columns for which you want to ensure distinctness. After identifying rows with unique values in the specified columns, PostgreSQL then needs a rule to decide which of the possible multiple entries to return for each unique combination—this is where the `ORDER BY` clause comes into play.

### How `DISTINCT ON` Works
When you use `DISTINCT ON (columns)`, PostgreSQL:
1. **Partitions** the result set based on the columns specified in `DISTINCT ON`. Each partition contains rows that have the same values for these columns.
2. **Sorts** these partitions according to the `ORDER BY` clause.
3. **Selects** the first row from each partition after sorting.

### Need for Matching `ORDER BY`
- **Logical Consistency**: Since `DISTINCT ON` picks the "first" row in each group defined by the distinct columns, the definition of "first" must be clear and deterministic. If the `ORDER BY` does not start with the columns specified in the `DISTINCT ON`, the database can't reliably determine which row should be considered the "first" within each group because the sorting wouldn’t align with the distinctness constraint.
  
- **Practical Example**:
    - Suppose you have a table of events with a `person_id` and `event_time`, and you want the earliest event for each person. You could write:
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT ON (person_id) person_id, event_time
    FROM events
    ORDER BY person_id, event_time;
    ```
    Here, `ORDER BY person_id, event_time` ensures that within each group of the same `person      _id`, rows are sorted by `event_time`. `DISTINCT ON` then effectively picks the row with the earliest `event_time` for each `person_id`.

### Why It’s Required
- **Execution Plan**: The requirement ensures that the database engine can efficiently execute the query by using an index or an internally optimized sorting mechanism. If the `ORDER BY` doesn't match, PostgreSQL cannot construct a predictable execution plan that guarantees the selection of a specific row from each group.

- **Avoid Ambiguity**: Without a matching `ORDER 

BY`, the result could be ambiguous because PostgreSQL wouldn't have a clear directive on how to prioritize one row over another within the same group, potentially leading to inconsistent results across different executions or environments.

### Best Practices
- Always start your `ORDER BY` clause with the columns used in `DISTINCT ON`. You can include additional columns in the `ORDER BY` to further specify how duplicates should be ordered within each unique group.
- Utilize indexes that align with your `DISTINCT ON` and `ORDER BY` clauses to improve performance, especially in large datasets.

This matching requirement is unique to PostgreSQL and is part of its SQL dialect's extensions, providing functionality not available in many other SQL databases, where you might have to use different approaches or more complex queries to achieve similar results.
